üéØ HUURLY PRODUCTION READINESS REPORT

  Based on my comprehensive analysis of your Huurly codebase, I've identified what needs to be done to make your SaaS production-ready. Here's a prioritized breakdown:

  üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Production)

  1. Missing Profile Creation Steps - HIGHEST PRIORITY

  Problem: Profile creation is completely broken
  Files: /src/components/modals/steps/ directory is missing
  Impact: New users cannot complete registration
  Fix: Create the 5 missing step components:
  - Step1_PersonalInfo.tsx
  - Step2_Employment.tsx
  - Step3_Housing.tsx
  - Step4_Lifestyle.tsx
  - Step5_Motivation.tsx

  2. Missing Login Route - HIGH PRIORITY

  Problem: Multiple logout redirects go to /login but route doesn't exist
  Files: App.tsx routing, multiple action hooks
  Impact: Users can't access login after logout
  Fix: Add login route or change redirects to /

  3. Database Schema Issues - HIGH PRIORITY

  Problem: Code references tables that don't exist in migrations
  Missing Tables: berichten, woningen, aanvragen
  Impact: Core functionality will fail
  Fix: Create missing table migrations

  4. Import Path Issues - HIGH PRIORITY

  Problem: Broken imports causing runtime errors
  Files: useBeheerderActions.ts (useToast import), storage.ts (logger import)
  Impact: Application crashes
  Fix: Correct import paths

  üîß MAJOR FUNCTIONALITY GAPS

  5. Incomplete Dashboard Actions - MEDIUM PRIORITY

  Problem: Many buttons only show placeholder implementations
  Files: useHuurderActions.ts, useVerhuurderActions.ts
  Missing: Search, settings, help/support, issue reporting
  Impact: Core user workflows don't work

  6. RLS Policy Vulnerabilities - HIGH PRIORITY

  Problem: Role-based access control has security gaps
  Files: Various migration files
  Impact: Potential privilege escalation
  Fix: Secure role validation mechanism

  7. Document Type Inconsistencies - MEDIUM PRIORITY

  Problem: Mismatch between service and UI document types
  Impact: Document upload failures
  Fix: Standardize document type definitions

  ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

  - Payment System: Exceptionally well-implemented with Stripe
  - Authentication: Enterprise-grade security
  - Cross-Dashboard Communication: Comprehensive real-time system
  - Database Operations: Solid foundation with good error handling
  - Cloudflare Storage: Well-integrated document system
  - UI Components: Professional component library
