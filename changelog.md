## Fix: Stripe Webhook Authentication Issue - January 2025

**Change:** Identified and documented the root cause of Stripe webhook 401 Unauthorized errors preventing successful payment processing.

**Problem:** The Stripe webhook was returning a 401 Unauthorized error when processing payment events, preventing subscription data from being saved to the database. This caused payments to succeed in Stripe but fail to update the user's subscription status in the application.

**Root Cause:** The 401 error indicates a signature verification failure in the webhook authentication process. This is typically caused by:
1. **Webhook Secret Mismatch:** The `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the `.env` file (`whsec_llbKajxO87WSbohpoSJMqeYciAqU79M4`) doesn't match the signing secret configured in the Stripe Dashboard for the webhook endpoint.
2. **Incorrect Webhook URL:** The webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard may not match the actual function URL (`https://sqhultitvpivlnlgogen.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`).
3. **Event Configuration:** The webhook may not be configured to send the required `checkout.session.completed` events.

**Solution:** 
- **Verify Webhook Secret:** Check that the signing secret in the Stripe Dashboard matches the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable.
- **Confirm Endpoint URL:** Ensure the webhook endpoint URL in Stripe Dashboard is correctly set to `https://sqhultitvpivlnlgogen.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`.
- **Validate Event Types:** Confirm the webhook is configured to send `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `customer.subscription.deleted` events.

**Technical Details:**
- The webhook function is correctly configured with `auth: false` and uses proper signature verification
- The RLS policies have been fixed to allow `service_role` access to the `abonnementen` table
- The `create-checkout-session` function successfully resolves customer IDs and passes `userId` in metadata

**Files Involved:**
- `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- `supabase/migrations/20250107000001_fix_abonnementen_service_role_policy.sql`
- `.env` (webhook secret configuration)

**Next Steps:** Update the Stripe Dashboard webhook configuration to resolve the authentication mismatch and enable successful payment processing.

## Fix: Stripe Payment Webhook Race Condition - January 2025

**Change:** Implemented a backend retry mechanism to handle a race condition between the Stripe webhook processing and the frontend's payment status check.

**Problem:** The frontend would occasionally display a "Betaling mislukt" (Payment failed) message even when the payment was successful in Stripe. This was caused by the frontend checking the subscription status before the Stripe webhook had finished updating the database.

**Root Cause:** A race condition existed where the client-side `handlePaymentSuccess` function would query the database for the subscription status immediately after payment, but the webhook's asynchronous processing hadn't yet marked the subscription as 'actief'.

**Solution:** 
- Modified the `handlePaymentSuccess` method in `PaymentWebhookService.ts` to include a retry loop with exponential backoff.
- The service now attempts to verify the subscription status up to 5 times over approximately 62 seconds.
- This makes the backend resilient to webhook processing delays, ensuring the frontend receives the correct status.

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/services/payment/PaymentWebhookService.ts`:
  - Refactored `handlePaymentSuccess` to poll the database for the 'actief' status.
  - Introduced a loop with `MAX_RETRIES` and exponential backoff to handle delays.
  - Ensured the function returns a proper `DatabaseResponse` in all scenarios (success, failure, and retry attempts).

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/payment/PaymentWebhookService.ts`
- `PAYMENT_FLOW_FIX.md`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** The frontend now reliably displays the correct payment status, eliminating false negatives caused by the webhook race condition. The user experience during the payment process is now more consistent and reliable.

## Fix: Step4Housing Component Syntax Error in Profile Creation Modal - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed React component crash in Step4Housing that was causing ErrorBoundary errors when users tried to access Step 4 (Housing preferences) of the enhanced profile creation modal.

**Problem:** The Step4Housing component was throwing a React parsing error due to a duplicate `</SelectTrigger>` closing tag, causing the entire profile creation modal to crash when users reached Step 4. The error was caught by the ErrorBoundary, preventing users from completing their profile setup.

**Root Cause:** There was a duplicate `</SelectTrigger>` closing tag in the property type selection dropdown (around line 58), which caused React to fail parsing the JSX and crash the component during rendering.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the duplicate `</SelectTrigger>` closing tag from the property type Select component
- Ensured proper JSX structure for all Select components in Step4Housing
- Verified no other duplicate closing tags exist in any step components

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step4Housing.tsx`:
  - Removed duplicate `</SelectTrigger>` tag in property type selection
  - Maintained all existing functionality and styling
  - Preserved proper Select component structure

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step4Housing.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users can now successfully navigate to and complete Step 4 of the profile creation modal without encountering component crashes. All form fields, dropdowns, and date pickers in the housing preferences section work correctly.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed component crash in profile creation flow
- Maintained all existing form functionality
- Ensured proper JSX syntax throughout the component
- Preserved user experience in profile setup

---

## Fix: EnhancedDatePicker Component Crash in Profile Creation Modal - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed React component crash in EnhancedDatePicker that was preventing users from completing Step 4 (Housing preferences) of the enhanced profile creation modal.

**Problem:** The EnhancedDatePicker component was throwing a React error at line 30:31, causing the entire profile creation modal to crash when users reached Step 4. The error was caught by the ErrorBoundary, but prevented users from completing their profile setup.

**Root Cause:** The Calendar component from react-day-picker v8 was receiving an invalid `locale` prop. The react-day-picker v8 library doesn't accept a `locale` prop directly on the Calendar component, which caused the component to crash during rendering.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the `locale={nl}` prop from the Calendar component in EnhancedDatePicker
- The Dutch locale formatting is still maintained through the `format()` function calls with `{ locale: nl }`
- Calendar component now renders without errors while preserving Dutch date formatting

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedDatePicker.tsx`:
  - Removed `locale={nl}` prop from the Calendar component
  - Maintained Dutch date formatting in display through format() function
  - Preserved all other Calendar component functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedDatePicker.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users can now successfully complete Step 4 of the profile creation modal without encountering component crashes. The date picker functionality works correctly with proper Dutch date formatting preserved in the display.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed component crash in profile creation flow
- Maintained Dutch locale formatting for dates
- Preserved all existing date picker functionality
- Ensured smooth user experience in profile setup

---

## Fix: Null Access Error in DashboardModals - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed null access error in DashboardModals.tsx that was causing the application to crash when tenantProfile was null.

**Problem:** The application was throwing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'geboortedatum')" error at line 45 in DashboardModals.tsx when trying to access properties of a null tenantProfile object.

**Root Cause:** The `getInitialFormData` function was directly accessing properties of `tenantProfile` without proper null checking, even though `tenantProfile` could be null when users haven't created a profile yet.

**Solution:** Added optional chaining operators (`?.`) to all `tenantProfile` property accesses in the `getInitialFormData` function to safely handle null/undefined values.

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/HuurderDashboard/DashboardModals.tsx`:
  - Added optional chaining (`?.`) to all `tenantProfile` property accesses
  - Ensured safe access to nested properties like `tenantProfile?.maxBudget || tenantProfile?.max_budget`
  - Maintained existing fallback values for when properties are null/undefined

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/HuurderDashboard/DashboardModals.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** The application no longer crashes when users access the dashboard without an existing tenant profile. The profile modal can now safely handle both existing and new user scenarios.

---

## Fix: Profile Overview Data Display Issue - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed the issue where profile data saved through the enhanced profile creation modal was not appearing in the "profiel overzicht" section of the huurdersdashboard.

**Problem:** After users completed and saved their profile using the enhanced profile creation modal, the profile overview in the dashboard remained empty or showed "N.v.t." (not applicable) values instead of displaying the saved information. The data was being saved to the backend but not properly retrieved and displayed in the dashboard.

**Root Cause:** The `handleProfileComplete` function in `useHuurder.ts` was mapping form data to field names that didn't align with the `CreateTenantProfileData` interface and database schema expected by `UserService.createTenantProfile`. This caused a structural mismatch between how data was saved and how the dashboard's `ConsolidatedDashboardService.mapTenantProfile` function expected to read it.

**Solution:** 
1. **Fixed Data Mapping:** Completely restructured the field mapping in `handleProfileComplete` to use the exact field names expected by the `CreateTenantProfileData` interface
2. **Corrected Service Call:** Changed from `userService.updateTenantProfile()` to `userService.createTenantProfile()` for proper data handling
3. **Aligned Field Names:** Ensured all mapped fields match the database schema that `ConsolidatedDashboardService.mapTenantProfile` reads from
4. **Added Type Safety:** Implemented proper type conversion for numeric fields using `parseFloat()`

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/hooks/useHuurder.ts`:
  - Restructured field mapping to use camelCase field names (e.g., `heeftKinderen`, `aantalKinderen`, `burgerlijkeStaat`)
  - Added proper type conversion for numeric fields (`maandinkomen`, `minBudget`, `maxBudget`)
  - Removed redundant and conflicting field mappings that caused data inconsistencies
  - Updated service method call to use `createTenantProfile` instead of `updateTenantProfile`
  - Ensured all required fields are properly mapped with appropriate fallback values

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useHuurder.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Profile data now flows correctly through the entire pipeline: form → service → database → dashboard display. Users can see their complete profile information in the "profiel overzicht" immediately after saving their profile, with all fields properly populated including personal information, work details, housing preferences, and lifestyle information.

**Key Features:**
- Complete data consistency between profile creation and dashboard display
- Proper field mapping aligned with database schema
- Type-safe numeric field handling
- Immediate profile overview updates after saving
- Full compatibility with existing dashboard display logic

---

## Enhancement: Pre-fill Name in Profile Modal from Signup Data - January 2025

**Change:** Updated the enhanced profile creation modal to automatically pre-fill the user's first and last name from the data they provided during account registration.

**Problem:** When a new user created an account, their name was not automatically populated in the enhanced profile modal, requiring them to enter it again. This created a disconnected user experience.

**Solution:** 
- Modified the `getInitialFormData` function in `DashboardModals.tsx` to accept the `user` object.
- When a new profile is being created (i.e., no existing `tenantProfile`), the function now extracts the first and last name from the `user.name` property.
- The user's full name is split into first and last names to populate the respective form fields.
- If an existing profile is being edited, the data from `tenantProfile` continues to be used, preserving any changes the user might have made.

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/HuurderDashboard/DashboardModals.tsx`:
  - The `getInitialFormData` function now takes an optional `user` object as an argument.
  - Logic was added to fall back to `user.name` for `first_name` and `last_name` if `tenantProfile` is not present.
  - The `user` object is now passed to `getInitialFormData` when rendering the `EnhancedProfileCreationModal`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/HuurderDashboard/DashboardModals.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** New users will now see their first and last names pre-filled when they open the enhanced profile modal for the first time, creating a smoother and more intuitive onboarding experience.

**Key Features:**
- Seamless data flow from registration to profile creation.
- Improved user experience by reducing redundant data entry.
- Maintains the ability to edit and update names in the profile independently.

## Bug Fix: Missing minBudget Property TypeScript Error - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed TypeScript compilation error in `useHuurder.ts` where the 'minBudget' property was missing from the `dutchProfileData` object being passed to `createTenantProfile`.

**Problem:** TypeScript error TS2345 occurred because the `dutchProfileData` object was missing the required 'minBudget' property when calling `userService.updateTenantProfile()`. The `CreateTenantProfileData` interface requires both `minBudget` and `maxBudget` properties.

**Root Cause:** The field mapping in `handleProfileComplete` function used `min_budget` instead of `minBudget`, causing a mismatch with the expected interface structure.

**Solution:** 
- Updated the field mapping to use `minBudget` instead of `min_budget`
- Added `parseFloat` conversion to ensure proper numeric type handling
- Updated `maxBudget` to also use `parseFloat` for consistency
- Ensured both budget fields provide fallback values ('0') to prevent undefined values

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/hooks/useHuurder.ts`:
  - Changed `min_budget: profileData.min_budget` to `minBudget: parseFloat(profileData.min_budget || '0')`
  - Updated `maxBudget: profileData.max_budget` to `maxBudget: parseFloat(profileData.max_budget || '0')`
  - Ensured proper type conversion and fallback handling for budget fields

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useHuurder.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** TypeScript compilation now passes without errors. The profile completion functionality works correctly with proper budget field mapping and type safety.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed TypeScript interface compliance for CreateTenantProfileData
- Proper numeric type conversion for budget fields
- Consistent field naming between frontend and backend
- Maintained fallback values to prevent undefined budget data

## Enhancement: Emergency Contact Relationship Dropdown - January 2025

**Change:** Converted the "Relatie noodcontact" (Emergency Contact Relationship) field in Step 6 from a text input to a dropdown with predefined relationship options.

**Problem:** The emergency contact relationship field was a free-text input, which could lead to inconsistent data entry and made it difficult to categorize relationships for potential future features or reporting.

**Solution:** 
- Replaced the text input with a dropdown component using the same pattern as the guarantor relationship field
- Added comprehensive relationship options in Dutch that cover common emergency contact relationships
- Used React Hook Form's Controller component for proper form integration

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step6Guarantor.tsx`:
  - Replaced `Input` component with `Controller` and `Select` components
  - Added predefined relationship options: Ouder, Partner, Broer/Zus, Familie, Vriend, Buurman/Buurvrouw, Collega, Anders
  - Maintained existing error handling and validation
  - Used consistent styling and placeholder text with other dropdown fields

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step6Guarantor.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users can now select emergency contact relationships from a standardized dropdown list, ensuring consistent data entry and better user experience. The dropdown includes common relationship types while still providing an "Anders" (Other) option for flexibility.

**Key Features:**
- Standardized relationship options in Dutch
- Consistent UI pattern with other dropdown fields in the form
- Maintained form validation and error handling
- Improved data consistency for emergency contact relationships
- Better user experience with guided selection instead of free text

## Bug Fix: Form Validation Issue with LocationSelector - January 2025

**Problem:** Even when users selected cities using the LocationSelector component, clicking "volgende" (next) still triggered a validation error requiring at least one place to be selected.

**Root Cause:** The validation schema in `stepValidationSchemas.ts` expected `preferred_city` to be an array of strings, but the LocationSelector component provides an array of LocationData objects with properties like `name`, `lat`, `lng`, and `radius`.

**Solution:** Updated the `step4Schema` in `stepValidationSchemas.ts` to use the correct `LocationDataSchema` structure instead of expecting an array of strings.

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/stepValidationSchemas.ts`:
  - Added `LocationDataSchema` definition with optional name, lat, lng, and radius fields
  - Updated `step4Schema.preferred_city` validation to expect `LocationData[]` instead of `string[]`
  - Maintained all existing validation error messages and requirements

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/stepValidationSchemas.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Form validation now works correctly when users select cities through the LocationSelector component. Users can successfully proceed to the next step after selecting their preferred locations without encountering false validation errors.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed validation schema mismatch between LocationSelector output and form validation
- Maintained all existing search functionality and UI behavior
- Preserved validation error messages and minimum selection requirements
- Ensured TypeScript type safety throughout the validation process

---

## Enhancement: LocationSelector UI Improvements and Terminology Update - January 2025

**Change:** Cleaned up the LocationSelector component by removing debug elements and updated terminology from "Gewenste steden" to "Gewenste woonplaats" for better user experience.

**Problem:** The LocationSelector component contained development debug elements (test buttons and console logging) that were not needed in production, and the terminology "Gewenste steden" (Desired cities) was less appropriate than "Gewenste woonplaats" (Desired residence location).

**Solution:** 
- Removed all debug elements including test buttons and query display
- Cleaned up console logging while maintaining error reporting
- Updated terminology across both LocationSelector and Step4Housing components
- Maintained the robust 3-tier search functionality (Nominatim API → Alternative endpoint → Mock data fallback)

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/ui/LocationSelector.tsx`:
  - Removed debug section with test buttons and query information
  - Cleaned up console logging (kept essential error logging)
  - Updated "Geselecteerde locaties" label to "Gewenste woonplaats"
  - Maintained all search functionality and fallback mechanisms
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step4Housing.tsx`:
  - Updated FormLabel from "Gewenste steden *" to "Gewenste woonplaats *"
  - Improved terminology consistency across the housing preferences form

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ui/LocationSelector.tsx`
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step4Housing.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** The LocationSelector component now has a cleaner, production-ready interface with improved Dutch terminology. Users see "Gewenste woonplaats" which better reflects the purpose of selecting desired residence locations rather than just cities.

**Key Features:**
- Clean, production-ready interface without debug elements
- Improved Dutch terminology for better user understanding
- Maintained robust search functionality with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Consistent labeling across the housing preferences form

## Fix: TypeScript Error in LocationSelector Component - January 2025

**Change:** Resolved TypeScript compilation error in `LocationSelector` component related to complex react-hook-form error type handling.

**Problem:** TypeScript error `TS2322` occurred in `Step4Housing.tsx` where the `error` prop type `string | FieldError | Merge<FieldError, FieldErrorsImpl<any>>` was not assignable to the expected `string | FieldError` type in `LocationSelector`.

**Root Cause:** The `LocationSelector` component's `error` prop type definition was too restrictive and didn't account for the complex nested error types that react-hook-form can produce, specifically the `Merge<FieldError, FieldErrorsImpl<any>>` type for nested field validations.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `LocationSelectorProps` interface to accept the full range of react-hook-form error types
- Created a safe error message extraction function to handle different error object structures
- Ensured proper ReactNode compatibility for error display

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/ui/LocationSelector.tsx`:
  - Updated `error` prop type to `string | FieldError | Merge<FieldError, FieldErrorsImpl<any>>`
  - Added `getErrorMessage` helper function for safe error message extraction
  - Replaced inline IIFE with dedicated helper function to ensure proper ReactNode compatibility
  - Fixed TypeScript error TS2322 by guaranteeing string return type for error display
  - Maintained backward compatibility with string error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ui/LocationSelector.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** TypeScript compilation now passes without errors. The `LocationSelector` component properly handles all react-hook-form error types while maintaining type safety and proper error message display.

**Key Features:**
- Full compatibility with react-hook-form error types
- Safe error message extraction for all error object structures
- Maintained ReactNode compatibility for JSX rendering
- Backward compatibility with existing string-based error handling

## Feature: LocationSelector Component with OpenStreetMap Integration - January 2025

**Change:** Implemented a sophisticated LocationSelector component that replaces the basic text input for `preferred_city` with OpenStreetMap Nominatim API integration, specifically designed for Dutch cities.

**Problem:** The existing `preferred_city` field was a simple text input expecting comma-separated city names, but the schema validation expected an array structure. Additionally, users needed a better way to select cities with location coordinates and radius preferences for housing searches.

**Solution:** 
- Created a comprehensive `LocationSelector` component with OpenStreetMap Nominatim API integration
- Implemented Dutch-specific filtering that shows only Netherlands locations
- Added automatic removal of ", Nederland" suffix from city names (displays "Amsterdam" instead of "Amsterdam, Nederland")
- Added support for multiple city selection with visual chips/badges
- Integrated radius selection (1-50km) for each selected location
- Implemented debounced search with loading states for optimal performance

**Technical Changes:**
- **Created:** `src/components/ui/LocationSelector.tsx` - Main component with:

  - Loading states and error handling
  - TypeScript interfaces for LocationData and NominatimResult
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/steps/Step3_Housing.tsx`:
  - Replaced text input with LocationSelector component
  - Updated FormField integration for array data structure
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step4Housing.tsx`:
  - Replaced text input with LocationSelector component
  - Updated FormField integration for array data structure
- **Modified:** `src/lib/validations/profileSchema.ts`:
  - Updated `preferred_city` from `z.array(z.string())` to `z.array(LocationDataSchema)`
  - Added `LocationDataSchema` with name, lat, lng, and radius fields

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ui/LocationSelector.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/modals/steps/Step3_Housing.tsx`
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step4Housing.tsx`
- `src/lib/validations/profileSchema.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**API Integration:**
- **Endpoint:** `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search`
- **Parameters:** format=json, countrycode=nl, limit=5, addressdetails=1
- **Rate Limiting:** Implemented 300ms debounce to respect API usage guidelines

## Feature: Auto-select Partner Checkbox Based on Marital Status - January 2025

**Change:** Implemented automatic pre-selection of the "Ik heb een partner" checkbox in Step 3 (Household) when the user selects "samenwonend" (cohabiting) or "getrouwd" (married) as their marital status in Step 1 (Personal Info).

**Problem:** Users who indicated they were married or cohabiting in Step 1 had to manually check the "Ik heb een partner" checkbox in Step 3, creating an inconsistent user experience and potential for oversight.

**Solution:** 
- Added conditional logic in `Step3Household` component to automatically set `has_partner` to `true` when `marital_status` is "samenwonend" or "getrouwd"
- Used React's `useEffect` hook to watch for changes in marital status and automatically update the partner checkbox
- Leveraged React Hook Form's `setValue` function to programmatically control the checkbox state

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step3Household.tsx`:
  - Added `useEffect` import from React
  - Added `setValue` to the destructured `useFormContext` hook
  - Added `maritalStatus` watch to monitor Step 1 marital status changes
  - Implemented `useEffect` that automatically sets `has_partner` to `true` when marital status indicates having a partner

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileSteps/Step3Household.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users who select "samenwonend" or "getrouwd" in Step 1 will automatically have the "Ik heb een partner" checkbox pre-selected when they reach Step 3, creating a more intuitive and consistent form experience.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic checkbox selection based on marital status
- Real-time updates when marital status changes
- Maintains existing form validation and functionality
- Improves user experience by reducing manual input requirements

## Fix: Profile Edit Modal Pre-population - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed the "profiel bewerken" (edit profile) functionality to pre-populate the enhanced modal with existing user data instead of showing a blank form.

**Problem:** When users clicked "profiel bewerken" to edit their profile, the `EnhancedProfileCreationModal` would open completely blank, forcing users to re-enter all their information from scratch even if they only wanted to update a single field like income.

**Root Cause:** The `EnhancedProfileCreationModal` was using hardcoded default values (empty strings and default numbers) and was not receiving any existing user data when opened for editing purposes.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `EnhancedProfileCreationModal` to accept an optional `initialData` prop of type `Partial<ProfileFormData>`
- Created a `getDefaultValues` function that merges default form values with provided initial data
- Updated `DashboardModals` to accept a `tenantProfile` prop and map it to the form's data structure
- Added `getInitialFormData` function to properly transform tenant profile data to form format
- Updated `HuurderDashboard` to pass the existing `tenantProfile` data to `DashboardModals`

**Technical Changes:**
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileCreationModal.tsx`:
  - Added `initialData?: Partial<ProfileFormData>` prop
  - Replaced hardcoded `defaultValues` with `getDefaultValues(initialData)` function
  - Form now pre-populates with existing data when available
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/DashboardModals.tsx`:
  - Added `tenantProfile?: TenantProfile | null` to props interface
  - Created `getInitialFormData` function to map tenant profile to form data structure
  - Passes mapped data as `initialData` to `EnhancedProfileCreationModal`
- **Modified:** `src/pages/HuurderDashboard.tsx`:
  - Added `tenantProfile={tenantProfile}` prop to `DashboardModals` component

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileCreationModal.tsx`
- `src/components/modals/DashboardModals.tsx`
- `src/pages/HuurderDashboard.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users can now edit their profile with all existing information pre-populated in the form. They can make targeted changes (like updating income) without having to re-enter all their personal details, housing preferences, and other information.

**Key Features:**
- All form fields pre-populated with existing user data
- Maintains existing validation and form flow
- Seamless editing experience for users
- Proper data mapping between tenant profile and form structure

---

## UI Enhancement: Validation Error Popup Modal - January 2025

**Change:** Replaced toast notifications with a custom popup modal for validation errors in the multi-step profile creation form.

**Problem:** The previous implementation used toast notifications that slid in from the right side of the screen to display validation errors. Users requested a more prominent popup modal that they can manually close for better visibility and control.

**Solution:** 
- Created a new `ValidationErrorModal` component using Radix UI Dialog primitives
- Replaced toast notifications in `ProfileFormNavigation` with the new modal
- Added visual improvements with alert icon and styled error list
- Implemented proper state management for modal visibility

**Technical Changes:**
- **Created:** `src/components/modals/ValidationErrorModal.tsx` - Custom modal component with:
  - Alert icon and styled header

  - "Begrepen" (Understood) button to close
- **Modified:** `src/components/modals/ProfileFormNavigation.tsx`:
  - Removed `useToast` dependency
  - Added state management for modal visibility and missing fields
  - Updated validation error handling to show modal instead of toast
  - Maintained all existing validation logic

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/ValidationErrorModal.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/modals/ProfileFormNavigation.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users now see a prominent, centered popup modal when validation fails, providing better visibility of missing required fields. The modal must be manually closed, ensuring users acknowledge the validation errors before proceeding.

**Key Features:**
- Centered popup with overlay background
- Clear visual hierarchy with alert icon
- Bulleted list of specific missing fields in Dutch
- Manual close action required from user
- Consistent with existing UI design system

## Fix: Vite/React Application Startup Error After Migration Cleanup - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed module resolution error preventing the Vite development server from starting after Next.js migration cleanup.

**Problem:** After discarding the Next.js migration and restoring the repository to its original state, the Vite development server failed to start with error: `Cannot find package '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc' imported from vite.config.ts`. This prevented the application from running in development mode.

**Root Cause:** The git reset and cleanup process removed the `node_modules` directory and some dependencies were not properly reinstalled, specifically the `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` plugin required by Vite configuration.

**Solution:** 
- Ran `npm install` to reinstall all dependencies from package.json
- Verified that all required devDependencies including `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` were properly installed
- Confirmed TypeScript compilation passes without errors

**Technical Changes:**
- Executed `npm install` to restore missing dependencies
- Verified dev server starts successfully on http://localhost:8080
- Confirmed TypeScript check passes with exit code 0

**Files Modified:**
- `node_modules/` (reinstalled)
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Vite development server now starts successfully and the application runs without module resolution errors. TypeScript compilation passes cleanly, confirming no code issues remain from the migration attempt.

**Key Learning:** After major git operations like hard reset, always run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly restored.

---

## Cleanup: Next.js Migration Documents Removed - January 2025

**Change:** Removed all Next.js migration-related documentation files from the repository.

**Problem:** After discarding the Next.js migration attempt and restoring the repository to its original Vite-based state, migration documentation files remained in the directory, creating confusion and clutter.

**Solution:** 
- Identified and removed migration-specific documentation files
- Kept legitimate database migration files in the supabase folder
- Committed the cleanup to maintain repository cleanliness

**Files Removed:**
- `FINAL_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration guide documentation
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Cloudflare migration summary

**Result:** Repository is now completely clean of Next.js migration artifacts, maintaining only the original Vite-based codebase and legitimate database migration files.

## TypeScript Error Fixes - January 2025

### Fix: Missing 'woningtype' Field in Profile Creation

**Change:** Fixed TypeScript compilation error in `useHuurder.ts` handleProfileComplete function.

**Problem:** The `CreateTenantProfileData` interface requires a `woningtype` field, but it was missing from the `dutchProfileData` object being passed to `userService.updateTenantProfile()`. This caused TypeScript error 2345: "Property 'woningtype' is missing in type but required in type 'CreateTenantProfileData'."

**Root Cause:** The `handleProfileComplete` function was mapping form data to Dutch field names but missed the required `woningtype` field, even though it was correctly implemented in the `toggleLookingStatus` function.

**Solution:** Added the missing `woningtype` field mapping to the `dutchProfileData` object:
```typescript
woningtype: profileData.housing_preferences?.property_type || profileData.preferred_property_type || 'appartement'
```

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `woningtype` field mapping in `handleProfileComplete` function
- Used same mapping pattern as existing `woningtype_voorkeur` field
- Added fallback value of 'appartement' to ensure field is never undefined
- Follows the same pattern used in `toggleLookingStatus` function

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useHuurder.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** TypeScript compilation now passes without errors (exit code 0). Profile creation functionality works correctly with all required fields properly mapped.

## UI/UX Improvements - January 2025

- **EnhancedProfileCreationModal**: Implemented automatic date formatting with forward slash separators for date inputs
  - Created reusable `DateInput` component with automatic dd/mm/yyyy formatting and cursor advancement
  - Updated `date_of_birth` field in `Step1PersonalInfo.tsx` to use new DateInput component
  - Updated `vroegste_verhuisdatum` and `voorkeur_verhuisdatum` fields in `Step4Housing.tsx` to use new DateInput component
  - Added proper validation in `profileSchema.ts` for date format consistency
  - Users can now type dates continuously (e.g., "13091990") and it automatically formats to "13/09/1990" with cursor advancement
- **EnhancedProfileCreationModal**: Updated modal width from `size="4xl"` to `size="5xl"` to prevent horizontal scrolling and better accommodate content
- **EnhancedProfileCreationModal**: Updated modal width from `size="lg"` to `size="4xl"` to match DocumentUploadModal width (896px vs 512px)
- Updated the HuurderDashboard to display the user's name instead of their email address.
- Removed the 'Cover Foto' and 'Profielfoto' titles from the PhotoSection.
- Modified the CoverPhoto component to make the 'Foto wijzigen' button permanently visible.

### Fixes
- Corrected the display of 'Woningvoorkeur' in the profile overview to properly format housing preferences and exclude undefined or empty values, showing 'N.v.t.' when no preferences are set.
- **Enhanced Profile Modal Responsiveness**: Converted `EnhancedProfileCreationModal` from raw Dialog components to BaseModal with `size="lg"` for better desktop width utilization, improved responsive behavior, proper margins, and consistency with other modals like DocumentUploadModal.
- Fixed TypeScript JSX structure errors in Header.tsx after removing Registreren button - resolved improper nesting and extra closing tags.
- Updated Header.tsx to remove Registreren button and style Inloggen button with orange background and white text.
- Modified HuurderDashboard.tsx layout to prevent overlaps: changed stats positioning, increased margins, made action buttons responsive with single column on mobile.
- Fixed a TypeScript error in the `handleProfileComplete` function by correctly mapping `stad`, `woningtype`, and `slaapkamers` to the tenant profile.
- Fixed TypeScript errors in the enhanced profile modal steps by removing extraneous closing braces.
- **Enhanced Profile Modal Width Fix**: Fixed width issue in EnhancedProfileCreationModal.tsx to prevent horizontal scrolling while maintaining responsiveness by updating DialogContent className from 'max-w-[95vw] sm:max-w-[480px] md:max-w-[520px] lg:max-w-[560px]' to 'max-w-[90vw] sm:max-w-[440px] md:max-w-[480px] lg:max-w-[520px]'. This ensures the modal stays within safe viewport bounds and eliminates horizontal scrolling on all screen sizes.

- **Issue:** TypeScript error due to missing `isHidden` property in `ProfileField` type.
- **Fix:** Added `isHidden?: boolean` to the `ProfileField` interface in `ProfileOverview.tsx`.
- **Enhancement:** Updated `ProfileOverview.tsx` to conditionally render fields based on the `isHidden` property, preventing hidden fields from being displayed.

### V1.1.3 - 2024-07-26
- **Enhancement:** Updated `HuurderDashboard.tsx` to display the user's full name in the `DashboardHeader` instead of their email address.

### Fixes

- **UI Bug:** Adjusted the profile picture in `PhotoSection.tsx` to correctly overlap the cover photo, improving the visual layout of the user's profile page.
- **UI Bug:** Corrected the positioning of the profile picture upload button in `ProfilePicture.tsx`. The button now correctly appears on top of the profile picture as intended.
- **Fix:** Resolved an issue where the clickable area of the "Foto wijzigen" button on the cover photo was inconsistent. The entire button is now responsive to clicks, improving user experience.
- **Fix:** Corrected the inconsistent clickable area for the cover photo upload button by separating the dropzone functionality from the label, ensuring the entire button is consistently interactive.
- **Feature:** The four statistics cards on the tenant dashboard have been moved to be next to the profile picture, under the cover photo. They have also been made smaller with less white space for a more compact and integrated look.

## Fix: Database Column Name Mismatches - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed TypeScript compilation errors caused by incorrect database column name references in ProfilePictureUpload.tsx and UserService.ts.

**Problem:** The application was using outdated column names that no longer existed in the database schema:
- `profielfoto_url_old` was being used instead of `profiel_foto` for profile picture URLs
- `kinderen` was being used instead of `aantal_kinderen` for children count filtering

**Root Cause:** Database schema changes had renamed/restructured columns, but the application code was not updated to reflect these changes. The migration files showed that:
- `profielfoto_url` was renamed to `profielfoto_url_old` and then the correct column became `profiel_foto`
- `kinderen` column was replaced with `aantal_kinderen` during table restructuring

**Solution:**
- Updated ProfilePictureUpload.tsx to use `profiel_foto` instead of `profielfoto_url_old`
- Updated UserService.ts to use `profiel_foto` for profile picture queries
- Updated UserService.ts to use `aantal_kinderen` instead of `kinderen` for children count filtering

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified ProfilePictureUpload.tsx: Changed `.update({ profielfoto_url_old: publicUrl })` to `.update({ profiel_foto: publicUrl })`
- Modified ProfilePictureUpload.tsx: Changed `.update({ profielfoto_url_old: null })` to `.update({ profiel_foto: null })`
- Modified UserService.ts: Changed `.select('profielfoto_url_old')` to `.select('profiel_foto')`
- Modified UserService.ts: Changed `tenant?.profielfoto_url_old` to `tenant?.profiel_foto`
- Modified UserService.ts: Changed `.gt('kinderen', 0)` to `.gt('aantal_kinderen', 0)`
- Modified UserService.ts: Changed `.eq('kinderen', 0)` to `.eq('aantal_kinderen', 0)`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ProfilePictureUpload.tsx`
- `src/services/UserService.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** TypeScript compilation now passes without errors (exit code 0). Profile picture upload/removal and children filtering functionality now work correctly with the current database schema.

**Key Learning:** Always verify database column names match the current schema after migrations, especially when columns are renamed or restructured.

## Fix: Database Migration Column Reference Error - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed critical error in huurders table restructure migration script that was causing deployment failures.

**Problem:** The migration script `20250105000000_restructure_huurders_table.sql` was failing with error "column 'kinderen' does not exist" during database push. The script was attempting to reference the `kinderen` column in a data migration step after it had already been dropped in an earlier step.

**Root Cause:** The migration script had incorrect step ordering - it was trying to migrate data from the `kinderen` column to new columns (`heeft_kinderen` and `aantal_kinderen`) in Step 8, but the `kinderen` column was already dropped in Step 3. This created a logical error where the script referenced a non-existent column.

**Solution:** 
- Reordered migration steps to perform data migration BEFORE dropping source columns
- Moved data migration from Step 8 to Step 2 (before column renames and drops)
- Updated all subsequent step numbers to maintain logical flow
- Ensured data is migrated from `kinderen` to `has_children` and `number_of_children` before renaming these columns to Dutch equivalents
- Removed duplicate data migration section that was causing the error

**Technical Changes:**
- Moved data migration logic to Step 2: `UPDATE public.huurders SET has_children = CASE WHEN kinderen > 0 THEN true ELSE false END, number_of_children = COALESCE(kinderen, 0)`
- Reordered steps: Data migration → Column renames → Column drops → Comments → Functions → Triggers → Indexes → RLS
- Updated step numbering from 1-11 to maintain logical sequence
- Removed redundant data migration section that referenced dropped columns

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250105000000_restructure_huurders_table.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Database migration now executes successfully without column reference errors. The huurders table restructure can be deployed safely with proper data preservation and Dutch column naming.

**Key Learning:** Always perform data migration operations BEFORE dropping source columns in database migrations to avoid reference errors.

## Migration Fix: Duplicate Key Constraint Error - January 2025

**Change:** Resolved duplicate key constraint violation when applying huurders table restructure migration.

**Problem:** Migration was failing with `ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "schema_migrations_pkey"` when attempting to apply migration `20250105000000_restructure_huurders_table.sql`. The migration version already existed in the `schema_migrations` table from a previous partial application.

**Root Cause:** The migration had been partially applied previously, leaving an entry in `schema_migrations` table. Attempting to reapply the same migration version caused a primary key constraint violation.

**Solution:** 
- Created new migration file with fresh timestamp: `20250714171602_restructure_huurders_table_fixed.sql`
- Copied the corrected migration content to the new file
- Deleted the problematic original migration file
- Successfully applied the new migration

**Technical Changes:**
- Created `supabase/migrations/20250714171602_restructure_huurders_table_fixed.sql`
- Deleted `supabase/migrations/20250105000000_restructure_huurders_table.sql`
- Migration applied successfully with exit code 0

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250714171602_restructure_huurders_table_fixed.sql` (created)
- `supabase/migrations/20250105000000_restructure_huurders_table.sql` (deleted)
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Migration now executes successfully without duplicate key constraint violations. The huurders table restructure is properly applied with correct data migration ordering.

**Key Learning:** When migration versions conflict, create a new migration with a fresh timestamp rather than attempting to modify existing migration entries.

## Fix: Payment Modal Flash on Login - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed payment modal flashing for users who have already confirmed their payment when they log in.

**Problem:** Users with active subscriptions were experiencing a brief flash of the payment modal during login, creating a poor user experience and confusion about their payment status.

**Root Cause:** A race condition in the payment modal visibility logic in `HuurderDashboard.tsx`. The modal was controlled by a useEffect that checked `!isLoadingSubscription && !isSubscribed`, but there was a brief moment during login where `isLoadingSubscription` became `false` before the actual subscription data had loaded, causing the modal to flash.

**Solution:** 
- Added `hasInitialDataLoaded` state to track when the first data load completes
- Modified the payment modal visibility logic to only show the modal after initial data has been loaded
- This prevents the modal from showing prematurely during the initial loading phase while maintaining correct behavior for unsubscribed users

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `hasInitialDataLoaded` state variable to `HuurderDashboard.tsx`
- Added useEffect to track when initial data loading completes
- Updated payment modal visibility logic to include `hasInitialDataLoaded` and `!isLoading` conditions
- Enhanced the dependency array to include the new state variable

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/HuurderDashboard.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Users with active subscriptions no longer see a payment modal flash during login, providing a smooth and professional user experience.

## Performance Optimization: Payment Processing Flow - January 2025

**Change:** Optimized the `create-checkout-session` edge function for significantly faster payment processing.

**Optimizations Applied:**
- Cached environment variables and Stripe/Supabase client initialization outside request handler to eliminate repeated setup overhead
- Implemented optimized customer resolution using try/create pattern instead of list/create to reduce Stripe API calls
- Streamlined session payload creation with type-safe constants
- Reduced logging overhead by removing verbose request/response logging
- Translated all error messages to Dutch for consistent user experience

**Performance Impact:** Reduced payment processing time by eliminating redundant API calls and client initialization overhead. The optimized customer resolution pattern reduces Stripe API calls from 2 to 1 in most cases.

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `create-checkout-session` edge function in `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- Moved client initialization outside request handler for better performance
- Optimized Stripe customer resolution logic
- Enhanced error handling with Dutch language support

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Faster payment processing with improved user experience through Dutch language support and reduced latency.

---

## Performance Optimization: Signup to Payment Flow - January 2025

**Change:** Optimized the `register-user` edge function for improved performance during user registration.

**Optimizations Applied:**
- Cached timestamp generation to avoid multiple `new Date().toISOString()` calls
- Cached `fullName` variable to prevent repeated string concatenation
- Removed unnecessary `.select()` calls for `verhuurder` and `beoordelaar` role creation (only kept for `huurder` role where verification is critical)
- Enhanced logging for all role types without performance impact

**Performance Impact:** Reduced database round trips and improved edge function execution time while maintaining all error handling and data integrity checks.

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `register-user` edge function in `supabase/functions/register-user/index.ts`
- Optimized variable caching and database operations
- Maintained comprehensive error handling for critical operations

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/register-user/index.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Faster user registration process with maintained reliability and error handling.

---

## Fix: 400 POST Error in Huurders Table Registration - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed 400 POST error occurring during user registration when creating huurders table records.

**Problem:** Users were being successfully created in `auth.users` and `public.gebruikers` tables, but the registration process was failing with a 400 POST error when attempting to insert into the `public.huurders` table. The Supabase logs showed the error was coming from the `register-user` edge function.

**Root Cause:** The error was caused by a foreign key constraint violation. The `huurders` table has a foreign key constraint `huurders_id_fkey` that requires the `id` to exist in the `public.gebruikers` table. While the `gebruikers` record was being created, there was insufficient error handling and validation to ensure the record was successfully inserted before attempting to create the dependent `huurders` record.

**Solution:** 
- Enhanced the `register-user` edge function with better error handling and validation
- Added `.select()` to the `gebruikers` upsert operation to verify the record was actually created
- Added validation to check that `userData` is returned before proceeding
- Enhanced error logging for the `huurders` insert operation with detailed error information
- Added validation to ensure `huurderData` is returned after the upsert operation

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `register-user` edge function to include comprehensive error handling
- Added detailed logging for debugging foreign key constraint issues
- Ensured proper validation of database operations before proceeding to dependent table inserts

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/register-user/index.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** User registration now properly validates each step of the process and provides detailed error information for debugging, preventing foreign key constraint violations.

---

## Fix: User Registration Race Condition - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed race condition in user registration process that prevented users from being created in public.gebruikers and public.huurders tables.

**Problem:** During user signup, the userMapper.mapSupabaseUserToUser function was attempting to query the 'gebruikers' table before the 'register-user' edge function had completed creating the user records. This created a race condition where the userMapper would fail to find the user data, causing the registration process to fail even though the user was successfully created in auth.users.

**Root Cause:** The userMapper was making database queries to fetch user role and profile information immediately after signup, but these queries occurred before the register-user edge function had time to insert the records into the public tables.

**Solution:** 
- Modified userMapper.ts to avoid database queries during initial user mapping
- Changed the fallback logic to rely on user metadata and email-based role determination instead of database queries
- This eliminates the race condition and allows the registration process to complete successfully

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated userMapper.mapSupabaseUserToUser to use supabaseUser.user_metadata?.role as fallback
- Removed database queries for 'gebruikers' and 'abonnementen' tables during initial mapping
- Maintained existing role mapping logic using roleMapper.determineRoleFromEmail

## Fix: User Creation Timeout - January 2025

**Change:** Resolved a 504 Gateway Timeout error that occurred during user registration.

**Problem:** The user creation process was failing with a 504 Gateway Timeout error. This was caused by the `register-user` edge function being blocked by restrictive Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `gebruikers`, `huurders`, `verhuurders`, and `beoordelaars` tables.

**Root Cause:** The RLS policies for these tables did not explicitly allow the `service_role` to perform insert operations. When the `register-user` function, which uses the `service_role` key, attempted to insert new records, the database would not respond, leading to a timeout.

**Solution:** 
- Updated the RLS policies for the `gebruikers`, `huurders`, `verhuurders`, and `beoordelaars` tables to allow the `service_role` to perform all operations.
- This was achieved by adding the condition `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role'` to the `USING` and `WITH CHECK` clauses of the policies.

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified the RLS policies for the `gebruikers`, `huurders`, `verhuurders`, and `beoordelaars` tables.

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250106000001_fix_huurders_rls_for_service_role.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** User registration now completes successfully without a timeout, and the RLS policies correctly handle both user-level and service-level access.

---

## Fix: RLS Policy for Service Role User Creation - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed RLS policies to allow service_role operations for user creation in production

**Problem:** User creation was failing in production with a 406 error when the register-user edge function tried to insert into the huurders table. The error occurred because the RLS policy "Eigen huurder" only allowed users to access their own records (auth.uid() = id), but when using service_role permissions, auth.uid() returns null, causing the policy to block the insertion.

**Root Cause:** Recent RLS security vulnerability fixes made policies more restrictive without accounting for legitimate service_role operations needed for user registration. The register-user edge function uses service_role permissions to create user records, but the RLS policies were blocking these operations.

**Solution:** 
- Updated RLS policies for huurders, gebruikers, verhuurders, and beoordelaars tables to allow service_role operations
- Added condition `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'service_role'` to both USING and WITH CHECK clauses
- This allows the register-user edge function to successfully create user records while maintaining security for regular user operations
- Maintains existing security model where users can only access their own records

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified "Eigen huurder" policy on public.huurders table
- Modified "Eigen gebruiker" policy on public.gebruikers table  
- Modified "Eigen verhuurder" policy on public.verhuurders table
- Modified "Eigen beoordelaar" policy on public.beoordelaars table
- All policies now allow both user self-access and service_role operations

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250106000001_fix_huurders_rls_for_service_role.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** User registration now works correctly in production while maintaining proper security restrictions

---

## Stripe Checkout Dutch Locale Configuration - January 2025

**Change:** Added Dutch locale parameter to Stripe checkout session creation

**Problem:** Stripe checkout pages were defaulting to the user's browser language or English instead of consistently displaying in Dutch for all users

**Root Cause:** The `create-checkout-session` function was not explicitly setting a locale parameter, causing Stripe to use default language detection

**Solution:** 
- Added `locale: "nl"` parameter to the sessionPayload object in the create-checkout-session function
- This ensures all Stripe checkout pages display in Dutch regardless of user's browser settings
- Maintains consistency with the existing Dutch language implementation throughout the application

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `sessionPayload` object in `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- Added `locale: "nl"` parameter to force Dutch language on all Stripe checkout sessions
- Complements existing Dutch language features like `mapStripeStatusToDutch()` in webhook handling
- Aligns with frontend `'nl-NL'` formatting used in `stripe-config.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** All Stripe checkout pages now consistently display in Dutch for all users

---

## Migration Fix: Betalingen Table Reference Error - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed migration error in `20250105000005_fix_betalingen_trigger_again.sql`

**Problem:** Migration was failing with error "relation 'public.betalingen' does not exist" because the migration was trying to drop a trigger on a table that was never created

**Root Cause:** The migration file contained a reference to drop a trigger on the `betalingen` table, but this table was never created in any previous migration

**Solution:** 
- Removed the line `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_betalingen_update ON public.betalingen;`
- Updated the comment to reflect that only the abonnementen table trigger is being handled
- Migration now only handles the existing abonnementen table

**Technical Changes:**
- Removed reference to non-existent betalingen table
- Kept the abonnementen table trigger handling intact
- Migration is now focused only on existing tables

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250105000005_fix_betalingen_trigger_again.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Migration now executes successfully without trying to reference non-existent tables

---

## Migration Fix: RLS Security Vulnerabilities Dependency Error - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed migration dependency error in `20250105000003_fix_rls_security_vulnerabilities.sql`

**Problem:** Migration failed with error "cannot drop view actieve_huurders because other objects depend on it" - specifically the `zoek_huurders` function depends on the view

**Root Cause:** The migration attempted to drop and recreate the `actieve_huurders` view without first handling the dependent `zoek_huurders` function that returns `SETOF public.actieve_huurders`

**Solution:** 
- Added `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.zoek_huurders(text, integer, integer, boolean, boolean)` before dropping the view
- Recreated the `zoek_huurders` function after the view is recreated
- Maintained the original view structure for compatibility
- Added `security_invoker = true` to the view for enhanced security
- Removed RLS policy creation on views (PostgreSQL doesn't support policies on views)
- Security for views is handled through underlying table policies and `security_invoker` setting
- Fixed `documenten_wachtend` view column reference from `g.voornaam` to `g.naam` (correct column name in gebruikers table)

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified the view recreation order to handle dependencies properly
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing function signatures
- Enhanced security with `security_invoker` and profile completeness checks
- Added `g.profiel_compleet = true` filter for additional security

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250105000003_fix_rls_security_vulnerabilities.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Migration now executes successfully with proper dependency handling and enhanced security

---

## Migration Fix: Check Constraint Subquery Error - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed check constraint with subquery in migration `20250103000007_add_enhanced_profile_fields.sql`

**Problem:** PostgreSQL doesn't allow subqueries in CHECK constraints, causing error "cannot use subquery in check constraint"

**Root Cause:** The constraint was using `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM unnest(children_ages)...)` which is a subquery

**Solution:** 
- Created a custom PL/pgSQL function `public.validate_children_ages()` to validate the array
- Replaced the subquery-based constraint with a function-based constraint

**Technical Changes:**
- Added `validate_children_ages(ages integer[])` function that validates array length and age ranges
- Function checks: array is null/empty, max 10 children, ages between 0-25
- Replaced complex CHECK constraint with `CHECK (public.validate_children_ages(children_ages))`

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250103000007_add_enhanced_profile_fields.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Migration now executes successfully with proper validation logic using a dedicated function

---

## Migration Fix: Storage Policies Duplicate Error - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed duplicate policy creation in migration `20250103000000_create_storage_policies.sql`

**Problem:** Migration was failing with error "policy already exists" because the policy "Allow users to upload own documents" was being created twice in the same migration file

**Root Cause:** The migration file contained two identical CREATE POLICY statements for the same policy on lines 19-23, causing a duplicate policy error

**Solution:** 
- Removed the duplicate CREATE POLICY statement
- Added `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements for all policies to make the migration re-runnable
- Made the migration idempotent to prevent future conflicts

**Technical Changes:**
- Removed duplicate policy creation on lines 19-23
- Added `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements before each CREATE POLICY
- Migration can now be safely re-run without errors

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250103000000_create_storage_policies.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Migration now executes successfully and storage policies are created without conflicts

---

## Migration Fix: Actieve Huurders View - January 2025

**Change:** Fixed migration error in `20250102000003_create_opgeslagen_profielen_and_search_rpc.sql` where the view was trying to reference non-existent `h.is_actief` column

**Problem:** Migration was failing with error "column h.is_actief does not exist (SQLSTATE 42703)" because the `huurders` table doesn't have an `is_actief` column

**Root Cause:** The migration was attempting to create a view `actieve_huurders` that filtered huurders by `h.is_actief = true`, but this column was never added to the huurders table schema

**Solution:** 
- Replaced the non-existent `h.is_actief` column reference with proper business logic
- Added JOIN with `abonnementen` table to determine active huurders based on subscription status
- Changed filter from `h.is_actief = true` to `a.status = 'actief'`
- Updated SELECT clause to include `a.status as abonnement_status` instead of `h.is_actief`

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.actieve_huurders` to join with abonnementen table
- Added `JOIN public.abonnementen AS a ON h.id = a.huurder_id`
- Changed WHERE clause to `a.status = 'actief'`
- This approach correctly identifies active huurders as those with active subscriptions

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250102000003_create_opgeslagen_profielen_and_search_rpc.sql`
- `changelog.md`

**Result:** Migration now executes successfully and the `actieve_huurders` view correctly shows only huurders with active subscriptions

---

## Database Migration Dependency Resolution - January 2025

**Change:** Systematically reorganized all database migration files to resolve dependency issues and ensure proper chronological execution order

**Reason:** Database push operations were failing with "relation does not exist" errors due to incorrect migration timestamp ordering. Migrations were executing out of dependency order, causing tables to be referenced before they were created.

**Implementation:**
- Analyzed all 23 migration files and categorized them into logical layers:
  - **Foundation Layer (20250101xxxxxx)**: Core tables and essential functions that other migrations depend on
  - **Dependent Tables Layer (20250102xxxxxx)**: Tables that reference foundation layer tables
  - **Enhancements Layer (20250103xxxxxx)**: Policies, indexes, and feature additions
  - **Data Layer (20250104xxxxxx)**: Initial data insertions
  - **Fixes Layer (20250105xxxxxx)**: Bug fixes and corrections
- Renamed all migration files with proper chronological timestamps to ensure correct execution order
- Used `supabase migration repair` to synchronize local and remote migration histories
- Verified successful database push after reorganization

**Technical Changes:**
- Renamed 23 migration files from various timestamps to organized chronological sequence
- Removed duplicate migration files to prevent conflicts
- Repaired migration history table to mark renamed migrations as applied
- Ensured all dependencies are resolved in correct order

**Files Renamed:**
- All migration files in `supabase/migrations/` directory
- Maintained original functionality while fixing execution order

**Result:** Database push operations now work successfully without dependency errors

---

## Enhanced Profile Modal Improvements - January 2025

## Form Input Border Visibility Improvement - January 2025

**Change:** Made form input borders darker for better visibility

**Reason:** User reported that form placeholder borders were very light gray and almost invisible, making it difficult to see input field boundaries

**Implementation:**
- Modified CSS variable `--input` in `src/index.css` from `214.3 31.8% 91.4%` to `214.3 31.8% 60%`
- This change affects all input components that use the `border-input` class
- Reduced lightness from 91.4% to 60% (about 35% darker) to make borders significantly more visible while maintaining the same hue and saturation
- User requested additional 20% darker adjustment for optimal visibility

**Technical Changes:**
- `src/index.css`: Updated `--input` CSS variable for darker border color

**Files Modified:**
- `src/index.css`
- `changelog.md`

## Date Picker to Text Input Change - January 2025

**Change:** Replaced the date picker for 'geboorte datum' in the enhanced profile modal with a simple text input that accepts dd/mm/yyyy format

**Reason:** User requested a simpler input method where users can just type the date in dd/mm/yyyy format (e.g., 13/09/1988) instead of using a date picker

**Implementation:**
- Modified `profileSchema.ts` to change `date_of_birth` validation from `z.date()` to `z.string()` with:
  - Regex pattern validation for dd/mm/jjjj format (Dutch localization)
  - Custom validation to ensure the date is valid (not 31/02/2023)
  - Date range validation (not in future, not before 1900)
- Updated `Step1_PersonalInfo.tsx` to replace `EnhancedDatePicker` with regular `Input` component
- Added automatic formatting that inserts slashes as user types
- Updated default value in `EnhancedProfileCreationModal.tsx` from `undefined` to empty string
- Added calendar icon to maintain visual consistency
- Updated placeholder and error messages to use Dutch format (dd/mm/jjjj)

**Technical Changes:**
- `src/components/modals/profileSchema.ts`: Changed date_of_birth validation to string with custom validation
- `src/components/modals/steps/Step1_PersonalInfo.tsx`: Replaced date picker with formatted text input
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileCreationModal.tsx`: Updated default value

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/modals/profileSchema.ts`
- `src/components/modals/steps/Step1_PersonalInfo.tsx`
- `src/components/modals/EnhancedProfileCreationModal.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

## Database Authentication Error Fix - January 2025

**Problem:** Getting 400 Bad Request error with "No API key found" when accessing admin dashboard, causing database queries to fail

**Root Cause:** The `useBeheerderDashboard` hook was making API calls to `userService.getUsers()` before authentication was fully established, causing Supabase queries to fail due to missing authentication context

**Solution:**
- Added authentication guards to `useBeheerderDashboard` hook
- Implemented proper timing checks to ensure API calls only happen after authentication is complete
- Added role-based authorization checks within the hook
- Improved error handling and logging

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated `src/hooks/useBeheerderDashboard.ts`:
  - Added `useAuth` hook integration for authentication state
  - Added authentication and authorization guards before API calls
  - Implemented proper loading state management based on auth status
  - Added role verification (only 'beheerder' can access)
  - Improved error logging with `logger` instead of `console.error`
  - Updated dependency array to include auth state variables

**Files Modified:**
- `src/hooks/useBeheerderDashboard.ts`
- `changelog.md`

## Password Reset Loading Issue Fix - January 2025

**Problem:** Password reset page was hanging in loading state after token verification

**Root Cause:** The `onAuthStateChange` callback in `authService.ts` was triggering heavy user mapping database queries through `userMapper.mapSupabaseUserToUser` after password token verification, causing the UI to remain in loading state

**Solution:** 
- Modified `ResetPassword.tsx` to directly use `supabase.auth.updateUser()` instead of the `useAuth` hook
- Added password validation using `passwordSchema` from `@/lib/validation`
- Implemented automatic sign-out after successful password update to ensure clean authentication state
- Bypassed the heavy user mapping process that was causing the hang

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx`:
  - Removed `useAuth` import and usage
  - Added direct Supabase client usage for password updates
  - Added `passwordSchema` validation (corrected import from `@/lib/validation`)
  - Added automatic sign-out after password update
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx`
- `changelog.md`

## Password Reset Flow Code Quality Improvements - December 2024

### Issue Fixed
**IMPROVED**: Password reset flow now uses proper auth service methods
- **Problem**: ResetPassword.tsx was directly calling `supabase.auth.updateUser` instead of using the centralized auth service
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent use of auth methods across the application
- **Solution**: Updated ResetPassword component to use `useAuth` hook's `updatePassword` method
- **Impact**: Better error handling, validation, and consistency with the rest of the application

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx` - Now uses `useAuth` hook's `updatePassword` method
- **Benefits**: 
  - Proper password validation using `passwordSchema`
  - Consistent error handling and messaging
  - Better integration with the application's auth flow
  - Centralized auth logic maintenance
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors after refactoring
- **Verification**: All Supabase auth types are correctly configured

## Password Reset Token Parameter Standardization - December 2024

### Issue Fixed
**FIXED**: Password reset token parameter standardized to use 'token'
- **Problem**: Supabase continued sending `token` parameter despite custom email template configuration
- **Root Cause**: Supabase default behavior uses `token` parameter for recovery flows
- **Solution**: Updated codebase to use `token` parameter and aligned email template accordingly
- **Impact**: Password reset links now work correctly with standard Supabase token format

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx` - Changed from `token_hash` to `token` parameter
- **File Modified**: `supabase/templates/recovery.html` - Updated template to use `{{ .Token }}` variable
- **URL Format**: URLs now use standard format `?token=ABC123&type=recovery`
- **Approach**: Aligned codebase with Supabase's standard token parameter format
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors after parameter change

#### Major Fix: Cover Photo and Profile Picture Rendering on Huurders Dashboard - January 2025

**Problem Analysis:** Cover photos and profile pictures were not rendering on the Huurders dashboard despite having upload functionality.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Missing Cover Photo URL in Data Flow**: `ConsolidatedDashboardService.getProfilePictureUrl()` only returned profile picture URL, not cover photo URL
2. **Incomplete Data Interface**: `ConsolidatedDashboardData` interface lacked `coverPhotoUrl` field
3. **Missing Hook State**: `useHuurder` hook didn't manage cover photo URL state
4. **Component Integration Gap**: `ProfilePhotoSection` component was not integrated into `HuurderDashboard`
5. **Undefined Cover URL**: `PhotoSection.getCurrentCoverUrl()` always returned `undefined`

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Enhanced ConsolidatedDashboardService.ts:**
   - Added `coverPhotoUrl: string | null` to `ConsolidatedDashboardData` interface
   - Renamed `getProfilePictureUrl` to `getPhotoUrls` with return type `{ profilePictureUrl: string | null; coverPhotoUrl: string | null }`
   - Updated `getHuurderDashboardData` to properly extract and assign both photo URLs

2. **Updated useHuurder.ts:**
   - Added `coverPhotoUrl` state management
   - Integrated cover photo URL from consolidated dashboard service
   - Included `coverPhotoUrl` in hook return values

3. **Fixed PhotoSection.tsx:**
   - Updated `getCurrentCoverUrl()` to return `coverPhotoUrl` from `useHuurder` hook instead of `undefined`
   - Ensured proper cover photo URL retrieval and rendering

4. **Integrated ProfilePhotoSection into HuurderDashboard.tsx:**
   - Added `ProfilePhotoSection` import
   - Integrated component into dashboard content sections
   - Enabled cover photo and profile picture upload/display functionality

5. **Fixed CoverPhoto.tsx:**
   - Corrected syntax error (duplicate `) : (` on line 79)

**Technical Details:**
- **Database Schema**: Both `profiel_foto` and `cover_foto` columns were already present in `huurders` table
- **Upload Infrastructure**: All upload components (`ProfilePicture`, `CoverPhoto`, `useImageUpload`) were functional
- **Cloudflare R2 Integration**: Storage and retrieval mechanisms were working correctly
- **Issue**: Data flow from database to UI components was incomplete

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/ConsolidatedDashboardService.ts` - Enhanced photo URL retrieval
- `src/hooks/useHuurder.ts` - Added cover photo state management
- `src/components/PhotoSection.tsx` - Fixed cover photo URL retrieval
- `src/pages/HuurderDashboard.tsx` - Integrated ProfilePhotoSection component
- `src/components/CoverPhoto.tsx` - Fixed syntax error

**Result:** Cover photos and profile pictures now render correctly on the Huurders dashboard with full upload and display functionality.

**Verification:** TypeScript compilation passes without errors after all modifications.

#### Bug Fixes
- Updated supabase import path in `CoverPhotoUpload.tsx` to resolve module not found error.
- Added missing 'userId' prop to `ProfilePictureUpload` component in `HuurderDashboard.tsx` to fix TypeScript type error.
- **Fixed Duplicate Validation Error Display**: Resolved issue where 'Geboortedatum' appeared three times in validation error modal by consolidating multiple Zod validation rules into a single refine function in `stepValidationSchemas.ts`.
