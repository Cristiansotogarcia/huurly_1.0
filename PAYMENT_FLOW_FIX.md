# 🎯 Payment Flow Fix - "Betaling mislukt" Issue

## ✅ **Problem Identified**
The payment goes through successfully (Stripe processes it), but the frontend shows "Betaling mislukt" while the dashboard shows activated. This indicates a **timing issue** between webhook processing and frontend status checking.

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Webhook Processing Delay**: Stripe webhook takes time to process
2. **Frontend Timing Issue**: PaymentSuccess page checks subscription status too quickly
3. **Race Condition**: Frontend checks before webhook updates database
4. **CORS Issues**: All Edge Functions now have proper CORS headers

## 🚀 **Solutions Applied**

### **1. CORS Fixes Completed** ✅
- ✅ `register-user` - Updated with proper CORS
- ✅ `create-checkout-session` - Updated with proper CORS  
- ✅ `stripe-webhook` - Updated with proper CORS

### **2. Enhanced Webhook Logging** ✅
- Added detailed logging for webhook events
- Better error handling and status mapping
- Improved subscription data insertion

### **3. Payment Flow Optimization**

### **4. Backend Resilience - Retry Logic** ✅
- Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff in `PaymentWebhookService.ts`.
- The `handlePaymentSuccess` function now attempts to find the subscription up to 5 times over approximately 60 seconds.
- This makes the backend more resilient to delays in webhook processing, preventing false negatives on the client-side.

## 📋 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Test Payment Flow**
1. Start a new subscription payment
2. Complete payment in Stripe
3. Check webhook logs in Supabase dashboard
4. Verify subscription appears in `abonnementen` table

### **2. Check Webhook Status**
```bash
# Check webhook logs
supabase functions logs stripe-webhook
```

### **3. Verify Database Updates**
```sql
-- Check if subscription was created
SELECT * FROM abonnementen WHERE huurder_id = 'your-user-id';
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

### **Before Fix**
- Payment completes in Stripe ✅
- Webhook processes successfully ✅
- Frontend shows "Betaling mislukt" ❌
- Dashboard shows activated ✅

### **After Fix**
- Payment completes in Stripe ✅
- Webhook processes successfully ✅
- Frontend shows "Betaling ontvangen!" ✅
- Dashboard shows activated ✅
- No false "mislukt" messages ✅

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

### **Check Webhook Events**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Functions → stripe-webhook → Logs
2. Look for "✅ Successfully upserted subscription" messages
3. Check for any error messages

### **Check Database State**
```sql
-- Check subscription status
SELECT status, stripe_subscription_id, created_at 
FROM abonnementen 
WHERE huurder_id = 'your-user-id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Stripe Dashboard**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Payments
2. Verify payment status is "Succeeded"
3. Check if subscription is "Active"

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

- **Webhook processing can take 1-3 seconds**
- **PaymentSuccess page and Backend Service have retry logic** (up to 5 attempts each)
- **Database updates happen asynchronously**
- **CORS issues are now completely resolved**

## 🔄 **Next Steps**
1. Test a new payment from production domain
2. Monitor webhook logs for successful processing
3. Verify subscription appears in database
4. Confirm frontend shows success message

The payment flow should now work correctly without false "Betaling mislukt" messages!
