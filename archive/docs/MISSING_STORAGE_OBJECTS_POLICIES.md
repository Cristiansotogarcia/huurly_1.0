# 🎯 MISSING STORAGE.OBJECTS POLICIES - THE REAL FIX!

## 🔍 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

From your screenshot, I can see you have bucket policies but **NO policies under "storage.objects"**. This is the missing piece!

You need policies on the **storage.objects table** itself, not just the bucket.

---

## 🔧 **REQUIRED FIX - ADD STORAGE.OBJECTS POLICIES**

### **Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
1. **Storage** > **Policies**
2. Scroll down to **"Other policies under storage.objects"**
3. Click **"New policy"** in that section

### **Create these 3 policies under storage.objects:**

#### **Policy 1: Allow authenticated users to INSERT**
- **Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated users to upload files`
- **Allowed Operation**: `INSERT`
- **Target Roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy Definition**:
```sql
bucket_id = 'documents'
```

#### **Policy 2: Allow authenticated users to SELECT**
- **Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated users to view files`
- **Allowed Operation**: `SELECT`
- **Target Roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy Definition**:
```sql
bucket_id = 'documents'
```

#### **Policy 3: Allow authenticated users to DELETE**
- **Policy Name**: `Allow authenticated users to delete files`
- **Allowed Operation**: `DELETE`
- **Target Roles**: `authenticated`
- **Policy Definition**:
```sql
bucket_id = 'documents'
```

## 🎯 **WHY THIS IS THE ISSUE**

- **Bucket policies** control access to the bucket itself
- **storage.objects policies** control access to the actual file operations (upload, download, delete)

You have the bucket policies but are missing the storage.objects policies, which is why you're getting 403 errors when trying to upload files.

---

## 🧪 **TEST AFTER ADDING THESE POLICIES**

1. **Add the 3 storage.objects policies** above
2. **Try uploading a document** again
3. **Expected Result**: No more 403 errors, successful upload

---

## 🚨 **ALTERNATIVE QUICK FIX**

If the above doesn't work immediately, you can temporarily disable RLS on storage.objects:

### **Go to SQL Editor and run:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE storage.objects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

This will allow all uploads temporarily while you debug the policies.

---

## 🎉 **EXPECTED RESULT**

After adding the storage.objects policies:
- ✅ **No more 403 Unauthorized errors**
- ✅ **Files upload successfully to storage**
- ✅ **Database records created in user_documents table**
- ✅ **Success messages shown to user**
- ✅ **Document upload fully functional**

**This should be the final fix needed! The storage.objects policies are the missing piece.**
