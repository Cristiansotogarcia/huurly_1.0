    *   **Rationale:** A lightweight and customizable icon library that integrates well with React applications.
*   **Data Visualization:** Recharts
    *   **Rationale:** For rendering interactive charts and graphs within dashboards (e.g., Admin and potentially Landlord analytics).
*   **Internationalization:** Fully Dutch language support
    *   **Rationale:** All user-facing text, including date formats, number formats, field names, and error messages, will be in Dutch. This aligns with the target market and enhances user experience.

### 5.2 Backend and Database

*   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase
    *   **Rationale:** Supabase provides a comprehensive suite of backend services, including a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time capabilities. Its open-source nature and robust feature set make it an ideal choice for rapid development and scalability.
    *   **Components Utilized:**
        *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for user registration, login, password management, and role-based access control. Custom authentication hooks will be used for enhanced email sending and JWT claim enrichment (e.g., adding user roles and subscription status to JWT for performance).
        *   **Database:** PostgreSQL for the relational database. All tables, columns, and relationships will be named in Dutch to maintain consistency with the application's language. Row Level Security (RLS) will be extensively used to enforce fine-grained access control to data.
        *   **Edge Functions:** Supabase Edge Functions (powered by Deno) for serverless logic, such as handling Stripe webhooks, custom email sending, and other backend processes that require secure, low-latency execution.
*   **File Storage:** Cloudflare R2
    *   **Rationale:** Cloudflare R2 offers highly performant, S3-compatible object storage with zero egress fees, making it a cost-effective solution for storing user-uploaded documents and images. Its global network ensures low latency for file access.
    *   **Usage:** All user-uploaded files, including profile pictures and sensitive verification documents, will be stored in Cloudflare R2. Public URLs will be generated for profile pictures, while secure signed URLs will be used for access to sensitive documents, ensuring controlled and temporary access.
    *   **CORS Configuration:** Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies will be configured on the R2 bucket to allow direct file uploads from the frontend application.
*   **Email Notifications:** Resend
    *   **Rationale:** Resend is a developer-friendly API for sending transactional emails. It will be integrated with Supabase Edge Functions to handle all authentication-related emails (e.g., password reset, signup confirmation) and other automated notifications (e.g., document verification status, viewing invitations).
*   **Payment Processing:** Stripe
    *   **Rationale:** Stripe provides a robust and secure platform for handling online payments and subscriptions. It will be used for processing tenant subscriptions, managing recurring payments, and handling webhooks for subscription lifecycle events.

### 5.3 Development Environment and Tools

*   **Local Development:** Supabase CLI for local Supabase instance management, Vite for fast frontend development server.
*   **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration.
*   **Deployment:** Vercel for frontend deployment, leveraging its integration with Git for continuous deployment. Supabase Edge Functions are deployed directly through the Supabase CLI.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive testing suite including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

### 5.4 Data Flow and Interactions

*   **Frontend to Backend:** Frontend communicates with Supabase via its client libraries for database operations and authentication. For file uploads, the frontend will directly interact with Cloudflare R2 after obtaining necessary credentials or signed URLs from the backend.
*   **Backend to External Services:** Supabase Edge Functions will interact with Resend for emails and Stripe for payment processing and webhook handling.
*   **Data Minimization:** Sensitive documents uploaded by tenants will be stored temporarily in Cloudflare R2 and deleted immediately after verification by a Beoordelaar, adhering to GDPR principles.

This architectural setup provides a solid foundation for building a performant, secure, and maintainable application, allowing for efficient development and future scalability.

*   **Code Readability:** Write clean, self-documenting code. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and files.
    *   Follow established conventions for the chosen language (e.g., `camelCase` for JavaScript/TypeScript variables, `PascalCase` for React components, `snake_case` for Python variables and database columns).
    *   Where applicable, use Dutch naming conventions for user-facing elements, database tables, and columns to maintain consistency with the application's primary language.
*   **Code Formatting:** Adhere to a consistent code formatting style. Utilize linters (e.g., ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript) and formatters (e.g., Prettier) to automate this process.
*   **Comments:** Add comments where the code's intent is not immediately obvious or for complex logic. Avoid redundant comments that merely restate what the code does.
*   **DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Extract common logic into reusable functions, components, or modules.

### 7.2 Frontend Development (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)

*   **Component-Based Architecture:**
    *   **Small and Reusable Components:** Break down UI into small, focused, and reusable components. A general guideline is to keep components under 150 lines of code to maintain readability and manageability.
    *   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component should ideally have a single responsibility.
    *   **Props and State Management:** Clearly define component props using TypeScript interfaces. Manage component state effectively, distinguishing between local component state and global application state.
*   **TypeScript Usage:**
    *   **Strict Typing:** Utilize TypeScript's strong typing features to define interfaces for data structures, props, and state. Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary and with clear justification.
    *   **Type Inference:** Leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities where appropriate to reduce verbosity.
*   **Styling (Tailwind CSS):**
    *   **Utility-First:** Prefer using Tailwind's utility classes for styling. Only create custom CSS when a utility class is not available or for complex, reusable patterns.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Implement responsive design using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).
*   **State Management (React Hooks, Context, Zustand):**
    *   Use `useState` and `useEffect` for local component state and side effects.
    *   Use React Context API for sharing state that is global to a subtree of components (e.g., theme, user authentication status).
    *   Consider Zustand for more complex global state management that needs to be accessed across the application efficiently.
*   **Form Handling:**
    *   Use `react-hook-form` for form management, leveraging its performance and validation features.
    *   Integrate `zod` for schema-based form validation, providing clear and consistent validation rules and error messages.
*   **Error Boundaries:** Implement React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle and display errors in the UI, preventing the entire application from crashing.
*   **Loading States and Skeletons:** Provide visual feedback to users during data fetching or long-running operations using loading indicators, spinners, or skeleton screens.

### 7.3 Backend Development (Supabase, Edge Functions)

*   **Database Schema Design (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Dutch Naming:** All database tables, columns, and relationships should be named using clear, descriptive Dutch terms (e.g., `gebruikers`, `huurders`, `documenten`).
    *   **Normalization:** Design the database schema to be normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
    *   **Indexing:** Create appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns to optimize database performance.
    *   **Row Level Security (RLS):** Implement robust RLS policies on all tables to ensure that users can only access and modify data they are authorized to.
    *   **Foreign Keys:** Define foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity between tables.
*   **Supabase Edge Functions:**
    *   **Single Responsibility:** Each Edge Function should ideally perform a single, well-defined task.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling within Edge Functions, logging errors and returning appropriate error responses to the client.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use Supabase secrets for sensitive information (API keys, credentials) within Edge Functions, never hardcode them.
    *   **CORS:** Ensure proper CORS headers are set for Edge Functions that are accessed from the frontend.
*   **API Design:**
    *   **RESTful Principles:** Design APIs following RESTful principles where applicable, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and clear resource naming.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming API requests on the server-side to prevent invalid data and security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging for API requests, responses, and errors to aid in debugging and monitoring.

### 7.4 Data Handling and Security

*   **GDPR Compliance:**
    *   **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data that is necessary for the stated purpose.
    *   **Temporary Storage:** Sensitive documents (e.g., income statements) must be stored temporarily in Cloudflare R2 and **deleted immediately** after verification by a Beoordelaar. No permanent copies should be retained.
    *   **Data Subject Rights:** Implement mechanisms to support data subject rights (e.g., right to access, rectification, erasure).
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
    *   **Secure Authentication:** Utilize Supabase's built-in authentication features and follow best practices for password storage (hashing and salting).
    *   **Access Control:** Strictly enforce role-based access control at both the frontend and backend levels.
    *   **Secure File Storage:** Use Cloudflare R2 with appropriate access policies and signed URLs for sensitive documents.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store all sensitive credentials and API keys as environment variables, never commit them to version control.

### 7.5 Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual functions, components, and modules to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the system (e.g., frontend and backend API calls, database interactions).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Implement E2E tests to simulate real user scenarios and ensure the entire application flow works correctly.
*   **Performance Testing:** Conduct performance tests to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system meets the defined performance requirements.
*   **Security Testing:** Perform security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

### 7.6 Deployment and Operations

*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring rapid and reliable releases.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring for application performance, errors, and security events. Utilize centralized logging solutions for easy debugging and analysis.
*   **Backup and Recovery:** Establish automated backup procedures for the database and file storage, along with a disaster recovery plan.
*   **Environment Management:** Maintain separate environments for development, staging, and production, with clear processes for promoting code between them.
