**Issue:** Third "Profiel aanmaken" button in step 7 of profile modal not saving data to database  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and fixed the critical issue where the "Profiel aanmaken" button in step 7 of the profile creation modal was not saving data to the database. The problem was in the `HuurderDashboard.tsx` file where the wrong service method was being called.

## The 3 Instances of "Profiel Aanmaken" - Confirmed

As you correctly identified, there are exactly 3 instances of "profiel aanmaken" in the application:

### 1. Homepage "Profiel aanmaken" ✅ WORKING
- **Location:** Homepage (Index.tsx)
- **Purpose:** For new users to sign up to the platform
- **Status:** Working correctly
- **Function:** Triggers user registration flow

### 2. Dashboard "Profiel aanmaken" ✅ WORKING  
- **Location:** HuurderDashboard.tsx (logged-in user dashboard)
- **Purpose:** For logged-in users to complete their profile
- **Status:** Working correctly
- **Function:** Opens the 7-step EnhancedProfileCreationModal

### 3. Step 7 Modal "Profiel aanmaken" ❌ WAS BROKEN → ✅ NOW FIXED
- **Location:** Step 7 of EnhancedProfileCreationModal
- **Purpose:** Final submission button to save all 7 steps of profile data
- **Status:** **WAS BROKEN** - Now fixed
- **Problem:** Was calling wrong service method
- **Solution:** Fixed to call correct service method

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `handleProfileComplete` function in `HuurderDashboard.tsx` was calling the wrong service method:

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```javascript
const result = await userService.createProfile(user.id, {
  firstName: profileData.firstName,
  lastName: profileData.lastName,
  email: profileData.email,
  phone: profileData.phone,
});
```

**Issues with the old code:**
1. ❌ Called `userService.createProfile()` - only handles basic profile data
2. ❌ Only passed 4 basic fields (firstName, lastName, email, phone)
3. ❌ Ignored all the enhanced 7-step modal data (nationality, marital status, income, preferences, etc.)
4. ❌ Data from steps 2-7 was completely lost

### The Solution
**AFTER (Fixed):**
```javascript
const result = await userService.createTenantProfile(profileData);
```

**Benefits of the fix:**
1. ✅ Calls `userService.createTenantProfile()` - handles complete enhanced profile data
2. ✅ Passes the entire `profileData` object with all 7 steps of information
3. ✅ Saves all enhanced fields: nationality, marital status, income, partner info, location preferences, amenities, etc.
4. ✅ Properly updates both `profiles` and `tenant_profiles` tables
5. ✅ Includes data reload after successful creation
6. ✅ Refreshes dashboard stats and documents

## Code Changes Made

### HuurderDashboard.tsx - handleProfileComplete Function

```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
const handleProfileComplete = async (profileData: any) => {
  if (!user?.id) return;
  const result = await userService.createProfile(user.id, {
    firstName: profileData.firstName,
    lastName: profileData.lastName,
    email: profileData.email,
    phone: profileData.phone,
  });
  // ... basic success handling
};

// NEW CODE (FIXED)
const handleProfileComplete = async (profileData: any) => {
  if (!user?.id) return;
  
  // Use createTenantProfile for the enhanced 7-step modal data
  const result = await userService.createTenantProfile(profileData);
  
  if (result.success) {
    setHasProfile(true);
    toast({
      title: "Profiel aangemaakt!",
      description: "Je complete profiel is succesvol aangemaakt en is nu zichtbaar voor verhuurders.",
    });
    
    // Reload profile and documents data
    const tenantProfileResult = await userService.getTenantProfile(user.id);
    if (tenantProfileResult.success && tenantProfileResult.data) {
      console.log("Updated tenant profile loaded:", tenantProfileResult.data);
    }
    
    // Reload documents
    const docsResult = await documentService.getDocumentsByUser(user.id);
    if (docsResult.success && docsResult.data) {
      setUserDocuments(docsResult.data);
    }
    
    // Reload stats
    await loadUserStats();
  } else {
    // ... error handling
  }
};
```

marital_status: sanitizedData.maritalStatus || 'single',
has_children: sanitizedData.hasChildren || false,

children_ages: sanitizedData.childrenAges || [],
has_partner: sanitizedData.hasPartner || false,
partner_name: sanitizedData.partnerName || null,
partner_profession: sanitizedData.partnerProfession || null,
partner_monthly_income: sanitizedData.partnerMonthlyIncome || 0,
preferred_districts: sanitizedData.preferredDistricts || [],
max_commute_time: sanitizedData.maxCommuteTime || 30,
transportation_preference: sanitizedData.transportationPreference || 'public_transport',
furnished_preference: sanitizedData.furnishedPreference || 'no_preference',

// ... and many more fields
