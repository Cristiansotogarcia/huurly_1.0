## Key Testing Scenarios

### Authentication Flow Testing
```
1. Multi-step registration → Role selection → Form validation → Email verification → Profile creation
2. Login → JWT token validation → Role-based dashboard access → Session management
3. Invalid credentials → Error handling → Security measures
```

### Business Process Testing
```
1. Tenant: Register → Create profile → Upload documents → Search properties → Apply
2. Landlord: Register → Add properties → Search tenants → Send invitations → Manage applications
3. Reviewer: Login → Review documents → Approve/reject → Trigger notifications
4. Admin: Login → Manage users → View statistics → System administration
```

### Integration Testing
```
1. Supabase Authentication → Role validation → Database operations
2. Stripe Payment → Webhook processing → Subscription activation
3. Real-time notifications → User preferences → Delivery confirmation
4. File uploads → Security validation → Storage management
```

## Security Testing Focus

### High-Priority Security Tests
1. **Access Control (TC008)**: Verify role-based restrictions across all user types
2. **File Upload Security (TC012)**: Validate file type restrictions and input sanitization
3. **JWT Security (TC014)**: Test token validation, expiration, and session management

### Security Validation Points
- Unauthorized dashboard access prevention
- File upload restrictions (type, size, content)
- Token tampering detection
- Session invalidation on logout
- Input sanitization for security vulnerabilities

## Performance & Load Testing

### Performance Criteria (TC013)
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000 simultaneous users
- **Response Time**: Monitor for acceptable thresholds
- **Error Rate**: Track system stability under load
- **Workflow Coverage**: Login, search, profile updates

## UI/UX Testing Requirements

### Mobile Responsiveness (TC010)
- Multi-device viewport testing
- Layout adaptation verification
- Dutch localization validation
- UI element usability on mobile

### Notification System (TC011)
- Real-time delivery verification
- User preference management
- Cross-role notification testing
- Immediate preference effect validation

## Error Handling & Validation

### Form Validation Testing
- Email format validation with clear error messages
- Required field validation in multi-step forms
- Document upload requirement enforcement
- Password strength validation

### Graceful Error Handling
- Invalid input rejection with user-friendly messages
- System error recovery mechanisms
- Network failure handling
- Data validation error display

## Integration Points

### External Service Integration
1. **Supabase**: Authentication, database operations, real-time features
2. **Stripe**: Payment processing, webhook handling, subscription management
3. **Cloudflare R2**: File storage and retrieval
4. **Email Services**: Verification and notification delivery

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Execute high-priority security tests** (TC008, TC012, TC014) first
2. **Validate core user flows** (TC001, TC004, TC006) for each role
3. **Test payment integration** (TC007) in staging environment
4. **Verify mobile responsiveness** (TC010) across target devices

### Testing Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Security and authentication testing
2. **Phase 2**: Core business function validation
3. **Phase 3**: Integration and performance testing
4. **Phase 4**: UI/UX and accessibility testing

### Quality Assurance
- Implement automated testing for regression prevention
- Establish performance benchmarks for monitoring
- Create security testing checklist for regular validation
- Document test results for compliance and audit purposes

## Conclusion

The generated test plan provides comprehensive coverage of the Huurly platform's critical functionality across all user roles. With 12 high-priority test cases focusing on security, core business functions, and system reliability, this testing strategy ensures thorough validation of the rental marketplace platform.

The emphasis on security testing (3 dedicated test cases) reflects the importance of protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access in a multi-tenant application. The inclusion of performance testing under load and mobile responsiveness testing ensures the platform can scale and provide a quality user experience across devices.

**Next Steps**: Execute the test plan in the recommended phases, starting with security validation and progressing through core functionality testing to ensure a robust and secure rental platform.
