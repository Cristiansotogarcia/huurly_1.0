- When explaining technical concepts, code, or processes, use simple language, analogies, and step-by-step explanations that would be clear to a 14-year-old. Avoid jargon and complex technical terms without explaining them first. Use examples and comparisons to everyday things when possible. Always respond to the user in English.

- Breakdown complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

- Always check for Type Script Errors when you finish a task and make sure the code is working before moving on to the next step. Use this command: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json`. Update the mem0 with a memory about this error and how you fixed it so you dont repeat the same mistake.

   
- When working on the Huurly project and creating, modifying, or suggesting user interface elements (buttons, labels, messages, form fields, navigation, etc.), always use Dutch language. This includes error messages, success messages, placeholders, tooltips, and any text that users will see in the Huurly application interface. Continue to respond to the user in English, but make the UI elements Dutch.
   
- Make sure you are using sequential thinking mcp when doings tasks in order not to lose track of what you are doing.

- Do NOT assume anything at anytime. You need to work fact based. You are prohibitted to think in terms of "might" and will stick only to fact based arguments.

- Use mem0 to remember every coding change you made that is important and use to retrieve memory of what has been done.

- Use Context7 to make sure all libraries used are up 2 date.

- Files in the Reffrece Docs Folder is ONLY to be used as reffrence. Do not use it in coding by any means!
