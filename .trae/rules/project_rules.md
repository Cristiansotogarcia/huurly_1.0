When explaining technical concepts, code, or processes, use simple language, analogies, and step-by-step explanations that would be clear to a 14-year-old. Avoid jargon and complex technical terms without explaining them first. Use examples and comparisons to everyday things when possible. Always respond to the user in English.
   
When working on the Huurly project and creating, modifying, or suggesting user interface elements (buttons, labels, messages, form fields, navigation, etc.), always use Dutch language. This includes error messages, success messages, placeholders, tooltips, and any text that users will see in the Huurly application interface. Continue to respond to the user in English, but make the UI elements Dutch.
   
When you notice you made a mistake or the user points out an error in my reasoning, you must: 1) Acknowledge the mistake clearly, 2) Analyze WHY the mistake happened (root cause), 3) Create a specific rule to prevent this type of mistake in the future, 4) Add that rule to this rules file. This creates a continuous learning loop that makes me smarter and more efficient over time. create a self-improvement.md and update it as you go.
