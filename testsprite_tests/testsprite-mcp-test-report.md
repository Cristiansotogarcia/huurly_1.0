## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement: Multi-Step Profile Creation
- **Description:** Supports multi-step tenant profile creation wizard with proper validation and form submission.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC002
- **Test Name:** Profile Creation Step Validation
- **Test Code:** [TC002_Profile_Creation_Step_Validation.py](./TC002_Profile_Creation_Step_Validation.py)
- **Test Error:** Testing of the multi-step tenant profile creation wizard validation was halted at step 2 due to a blocking issue where valid inputs did not allow progression. Validation on step 1 was successful, but step 2 form submission did not navigate forward or show success. Further testing cannot continue until this issue is resolved.

- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/b563aaea-0d2b-4209-9ab9-cd9db63b3c41/990ae26a-316b-4b74-bcaa-799f059be3a5
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** High
- **Analysis / Findings:** The test failed because the multi-step tenant profile creation wizard could not progress beyond step 2 despite valid inputs. This indicates a functional issue in the form submission or validation logic on step 2, possibly due to a backend API returning a 400 error when attempting to register the user, leading to a blocking error that prevents navigation forward.

**Recommendation:** Investigate the 400 error returned from the backend registration endpoint. Ensure the frontend is sending valid and complete data as expected by the API. Add proper error handling to display meaningful messages to the user. Debug the form validation and submission logic at step 2 to confirm it aligns with backend validation rules. Coordinate with backend developers to identify any mismatches in expected data or validation criteria. Additionally, address any accessibility warnings for dialog content for better UX.

## 3️⃣ Coverage & Matching Metrics

- **100% of product requirements tested**
- **0% of tests passed**
- **Key gaps / risks:**

> 100% of product requirements had at least one test generated.
> 0% of tests passed fully.
> **Critical Risk:** The multi-step profile creation wizard has a blocking issue at step 2 that prevents user registration. This is a high-severity issue that affects core functionality and user onboarding.

## 4️⃣ Summary

The testing revealed a critical issue in the multi-step profile creation wizard where users cannot progress beyond step 2 due to a backend API error (400 status). This blocks the entire user registration flow and requires immediate attention. The issue appears to be related to data validation or API endpoint configuration rather than frontend form validation, as the test was updated to properly fill all required fields including the 'Beroep' (profession) field.

**Immediate Action Required:** Fix the backend registration endpoint to properly handle the profile creation data being sent from the frontend.
