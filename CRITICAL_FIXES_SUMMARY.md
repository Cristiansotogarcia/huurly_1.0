# Critical Fixes Applied - Registration, Email Verification & Payment Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Registration Hanging Issue
**Problem**: Registration process was hanging indefinitely after clicking "Registreren..."
**Root Cause**: SignupForm was trying to navigate to dashboard before email confirmation
**Solution**: 
- Removed immediate navigation from SignupForm
- Let useAuth hook handle proper email confirmation flow
- User now sees email confirmation modal instead of hanging

### 2. ✅ Email Verification Modal Redirect Issue
**Problem**: After email verification, modal appeared but "Naar Dashboard" button didn't work
**Root Cause**: User auth state wasn't properly updated when modal tried to redirect
**Solution**:
- Added longer delays to ensure auth state is properly updated
- Enhanced error handling with fallback to page refresh
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Improved auth state checking before navigation

### 3. ✅ Payment Checkout Session Error
**Problem**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'priceId')" error when clicking "Abonnement afsluiten"
**Root Cause**: Multiple services still referencing old `yearly` plan instead of new `halfyearly` plan
**Solution**: Updated all service references:
- `src/services/PaymentService.ts` - Fixed `getPricingInfo()` method
- `src/services/payment/StripeCheckoutService.ts` - Fixed checkout session creation
- `src/services/payment/PricingService.ts` - Fixed pricing info and description text

## Files Modified

### Payment Service Fixes
1. **`src/services/PaymentService.ts`**
   ```typescript
   // Before: SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.yearly
   // After: SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.halfyearly
   ```

2. **`src/services/payment/StripeCheckoutService.ts`**
   ```typescript
   // Before: const plan = SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.yearly;
   // After: const plan = SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.halfyearly;
   ```

3. **`src/services/payment/PricingService.ts`**
   ```typescript
   // Before: const plan = SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.yearly;
   // After: const plan = SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.halfyearly;
   // Also updated description text from "per jaar" to "per 6 maanden"
   ```

### Registration & Email Verification Fixes
4. **`src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx`**
   - Removed immediate dashboard navigation after signup
   - Let useAuth hook handle email confirmation flow

5. **`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`**
   - Added email verification detection to prevent auto-redirect conflicts
   - Enhanced auth state change handling

6. **`src/pages/Index.tsx`**
   - Enhanced email verification modal redirect with better error handling
   - Added longer delays and fallback mechanisms
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Details

### Payment Error Resolution
The "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'priceId')" error was caused by:
1. Services trying to access `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.yearly.priceId`
2. But we changed the plan structure to `SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS.huurder.halfyearly`
3. This caused `undefined` access when trying to read `priceId`

**Fix**: Updated all service references to use `halfyearly` instead of `yearly`

### Email Verification Flow Enhancement
The modal redirect issue was caused by:
1. User auth state not being fully updated when modal tried to redirect
2. Race condition between modal close and navigation
3. Missing fallback handling for delayed auth state updates

**Fix**: 
- Added 200ms initial delay for modal close
- Added 1000ms secondary delay for auth state update
- Added fallback page refresh if auth state still not ready
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### Registration Flow Improvement
The hanging issue was caused by:
1. SignupForm trying to navigate before user was authenticated
2. User needs to confirm email before being fully authenticated
3. Conflicting navigation logic

**Fix**:
- Removed premature navigation from SignupForm
- Let useAuth hook manage the proper flow
- Email confirmation modal now appears correctly

## User Experience Improvements
