## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### BaseModal System Components

#### 1. BaseModal Component
```typescript
interface BaseModalProps {
  open: boolean;
  onOpenChange: (open: boolean) => void;
  title: string;
  icon?: LucideIcon;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' | '2xl' | '4xl' | '6xl';
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

#### 2. BaseModalActions Component
```typescript
interface BaseModalActionsProps {
  cancelAction?: ActionConfig;
  primaryAction?: ActionConfig;
  customActions?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

#### 3. Utility Hooks
- **useModalState:** Manages loading states and form submission
- **useModalForm:** Handles form data, validation, and field updates

### Established Modal Patterns

#### Simple Form Modal Pattern
```typescript
const SimpleModal = ({ open, onOpenChange, onSubmit }) => {
  const { isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting } = useModalState();
  const { data, updateField, isValid } = useModalForm(initialData, validateFn);
  
  return (
    <BaseModal open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange} title="Title" icon={Icon}>
      {/* Form fields */}
      <BaseModalActions
        cancelAction={{ onClick: () => onOpenChange(false) }}
        primaryAction={{ label: 'Submit', onClick: handleSubmit, loading: isSubmitting }}
      />
    </BaseModal>
  );
};
```

#### Complex Tabbed Modal Pattern
```typescript
const TabbedModal = ({ open, onOpenChange }) => {
  return (
    <BaseModal open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange} title="Title" icon={Icon} size="4xl">
      <Tabs defaultValue="tab1">
        <TabsList>...</TabsList>
        <TabsContent>...</TabsContent>
      </Tabs>
      <BaseModalActions customActions={<CustomButtonLayout />} />
    </BaseModal>
  );
};
```

#### Multi-Step Wizard Pattern
```typescript
const WizardModal = ({ open, onOpenChange }) => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(1);
  
  return (
    <BaseModal open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange} title="Title" icon={Icon}>
      <Progress value={(currentStep / totalSteps) * 100} />
      {renderStep()}
      <BaseModalActions customActions={<StepNavigation />} />
    </BaseModal>
  );
};
```
