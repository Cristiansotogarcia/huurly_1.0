# Upload Fixes Summary

## Issue
The error `TypeError: readableStream.getReader is not a function` was occurring when trying to upload profile pictures. This was caused by the AWS SDK's chunked encoding stream expecting a proper readable stream format.

## Root Cause
The AWS SDK v3 was receiving a browser File object directly, which wasn't compatible with the SDK's expected input format for the `Body` parameter in `PutObjectCommand`.

## Solution
Updated the file upload handling to convert browser File objects to Uint8Array format, which is compatible with AWS SDK v3.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/lib/storage.ts`
- **Fixed file upload compatibility**: Changed from passing File objects directly to converting them to Uint8Array using `file.arrayBuffer()` and `new Uint8Array()`
- **Applied fix to all upload methods**:
  - `uploadFile()`
  - `uploadDocument()`
  - `uploadPropertyImage()`
  - `uploadProfilePicture()`

### 2. Updated `src/components/ProfilePictureUpload.tsx`
- **Removed direct AWS SDK usage**: Replaced direct AWS SDK calls with the centralized `storageService`
- **Simplified upload logic**: Now uses `storageService.uploadProfilePicture()` instead of manual AWS SDK operations
- **Improved error handling**: Leverages the storage service's built-in error handling
- **Maintained same functionality**: All existing features preserved (file validation, existing file deletion, etc.)

### 3. Dependencies
- **Added buffer package**: Installed `buffer` package for better Node.js compatibility in browser environment
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality maintained

## Technical Details
- **File conversion**: `File → ArrayBuffer → Uint8Array` ensures AWS SDK compatibility
- **Memory efficient**: Uses streaming approach with ArrayBuffer instead of loading entire file into memory
- **Cross-browser compatible**: Uses standard Web APIs that work across all modern browsers

## CORS Configuration Required
After fixing the readableStream issue, you may encounter a CORS error when testing locally. This is expected and requires Cloudflare R2 configuration.

### CORS Error Message
```
Access to fetch at 'https://...r2.cloudflarestorage.com/...' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

### Solution: Configure Cloudflare R2 CORS
1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard** → R2 → Buckets → Select your bucket
2. **Navigate to Settings** → CORS
3. **Add CORS rule** with these settings:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "AllowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:8080", "https://localhost:8080", "https://huurly-1-0.vercel.app"],
       "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
       "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
     }
   ]
   ```

## Testing
1. **Test CORS**: Run the test script in browser console: `node test-cors-fix.js`
2. **Test uploads**: After CORS configuration, test profile picture uploads
3. **Verify**: Check Cloudflare R2 dashboard for uploaded files

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/storage.ts` - Fixed upload compatibility issues
- `src/components/ProfilePictureUpload.tsx` - Refactored to use storage service
- `package.json` - Added buffer dependency
- `test-cors-fix.js` - Added CORS testing script
