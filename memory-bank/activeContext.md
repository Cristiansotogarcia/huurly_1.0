# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
As of July 17, 2025, the Huurly project is in **active development phase** with focus on:

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Image Upload System**: Implementing Cloudflare R2 integration with direct upload
2. **Profile Photo Management**: Building user profile photo upload and management
3. **Subscription System**: Integrating Stripe for subscription management
4. **Dashboard Refinement**: Improving user dashboards for all roles

### Recently Completed
- ✅ Cloudflare R2 bucket setup and configuration
- ✅ Image optimization pipeline with multiple sizes
- ✅ Direct upload functionality with signed URLs
- ✅ Profile photo upload component with preview
- ✅ Basic subscription management with Stripe

### Current Development Branch
- **Feature**: Enhanced image upload with progress tracking
- **Component**: ProfilePictureUpload with drag-and-drop
- **Integration**: Cloudflare Workers for edge image processing

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Image Storage Strategy**: Using Cloudflare R2 for images, Supabase for documents
2. **Upload Flow**: Direct browser upload to R2 with signed URLs for security
3. **Image Sizes**: Generating 5 sizes (thumbnail, small, medium, large, original)
4. **CDN Strategy**: Cloudflare's global CDN for optimal delivery

### UX Considerations
1. **Progress Indicators**: Real-time upload progress for better UX
2. **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive file upload with visual feedback
3. **Image Preview**: Instant preview before upload
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Images load as they enter viewport
2. **WebP Format**: Primary format with JPEG fallback
3. **Responsive Images**: Automatic size selection based on device
4. **Caching**: Aggressive caching at CDN level

## Next Steps

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Complete profile photo management UI
2. Implement image deletion functionality
3. Add image cropping/editing capabilities
4. Test upload limits and error scenarios

### Medium-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Integrate subscription management with user roles
2. Build property image gallery with multiple uploads
3. Implement document upload for tenant applications
4. Add image compression before upload

### Long-term (Next Month)
1. AI-powered image optimization
2. Advanced image editing (crop, rotate, filters)
3. Bulk upload functionality
4. Image CDN analytics and monitoring

## Current Blockers & Issues
- **Image Size Validation**: Need better client-side validation before upload
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of network interruptions
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly drag and drop needs refinement
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for upload components

## Recent Learnings
1. **Cloudflare R2**: Direct upload works well but requires careful CORS configuration
2. **Image Processing**: Sharp library in Cloudflare Workers is very efficient
3. **User Behavior**: Users expect immediate feedback during uploads
4. **Performance**: CDN delivery significantly improves load times globally

## Team Notes
- **Development**: Focus on stability and error handling
- **Design**: Refining upload UI based on user feedback
- **Testing**: Need comprehensive test suite for upload flows
- **Documentation**: Updating setup guides for new team members
